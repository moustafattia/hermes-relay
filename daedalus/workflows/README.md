# Daedalus workflows

Each subdirectory under `workflows/` is one **workflow** — a Python
package implementing the stages, gates, and agent dispatch for a
specific lifecycle. The first workflow we ship and dogfood is
`code_review/` (`Issue → Code → Review → Merge`).

Workflows are loaded by name through `workflows.<slug>`. The dispatcher
in `__init__.py` enforces a small contract: every workflow package must
expose `NAME`, `SUPPORTED_SCHEMA_VERSIONS`, `CONFIG_SCHEMA_PATH`,
`make_workspace(...)`, and `cli_main(workspace, argv)`.

## Naming

- Workflow type: external contract in `WORKFLOW.md` front matter, always `lower-kebab-case` such as `code-review`.
- Workflow package: Python slug under `workflows/`, always `lower_snake_case` such as `code_review/`.
- Workflow instance root: directory under `~/.hermes/workflows/`, always `<owner>-<repo>-<workflow-type>`.
- `instance.name` in `WORKFLOW.md` should match the workflow root directory name.

## How a workflow runs

1. Daedalus's tick loop loads `WORKFLOW.md` from the workflow root
   (or legacy `config/workflow.yaml` when migrating older instances).
2. The dispatcher imports the workflow package referenced by
   `workflow:` in the config (e.g. `code-review`).
3. `make_workspace(workflow_root, config)` returns the workspace
   object the CLI subcommands operate on.
4. Per-tick: preflight validates the config; if it passes, the
   orchestrator picks a lane and dispatches the next agent role.

## Adding a new workflow

1. Create `workflows/<your-name>/__init__.py` implementing the five
   required attributes from the contract.
2. Add a `schema.yaml` defining the workflow's config shape.
3. Implement `cli_main(workspace, argv)` so operators can run
   `/workflow <your-name> status` and friends.
4. Reference it from `WORKFLOW.md` front matter in the workflow root:
   `workflow: <your-name>`.

The `code_review/` package is the reference implementation — start by
copying its `__init__.py`, `cli.py`, and `schema.yaml` and pruning what
you don't need.
