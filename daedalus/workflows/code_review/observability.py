"""Effective observability config resolution.

Resolution precedence (highest first):

1. Override file at ``<override_dir>/observability-overrides.json`` (per-workflow,
   set by the operator via the ``/daedalus set-observability`` slash command).
2. ``observability:`` block in the workflow contract (normally ``WORKFLOW.md``).
3. Hardcoded defaults (everything off).

The override file is canonical for "right now this workflow's observability is X"
without forcing an edit-and-redeploy cycle on the workflow contract.
