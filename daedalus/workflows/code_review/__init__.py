"""Code-review workflow package for Daedalus.

This package will absorb project-specific workflow semantics from the legacy
wrapper over multiple slices. The initial slice adds central path resolution
and directory scaffolding without changing workflow policy yet.

This package satisfies the daedalus workflow-plugin contract:

- NAME: the canonical hyphenated workflow name ("code-review")
- SUPPORTED_SCHEMA_VERSIONS: tuple of config schema versions this module accepts
- CONFIG_SCHEMA_PATH: Path to the JSON Schema validating the workflow contract
- make_workspace(*, workflow_root, config): factory returning the workspace accessor
- cli_main(workspace, argv): argparse-backed CLI dispatcher

# Codex P1 on PR #21: preflight must ONLY gate commands that actually
# attempt dispatch. Diagnostic / repair / read-only commands like status,
# reconcile, doctor, preflight-* must remain available even when the
# config has a missing credential or unsupported runtime kind, because
# operators rely on them to debug exactly that situation.
#
# Commands listed here trigger the run_preflight() check in the
# generic dispatcher (workflows/__init__.py::run_cli). Anything not in
# this set runs without preflight gating.
