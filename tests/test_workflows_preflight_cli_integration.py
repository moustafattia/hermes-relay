"""Smoke integration: run_cli + preflight failure path.

Builds a minimal workflow_root with an unsupported runtime.kind and
verifies:

1. ``workflows.run_cli`` raises ``WorkflowContractError`` with the
   preflight error code/detail in the message.
2. A ``daedalus.dispatch_skipped`` event with ``code=unsupported_runtime_kind``
   was appended to the workflow event log.
