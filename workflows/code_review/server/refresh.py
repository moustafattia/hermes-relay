"""Coalescing tick-trigger for ``POST /api/v1/refresh``.

Daedalus is a CLI-tick architecture — there is no in-process tick loop
to share state with. So instead of poking a ``threading.Event`` that the
tick observes, the refresh endpoint shells out a tick subprocess best
effort. Concurrent refresh requests collapse into one subprocess per
debounce window, so a flurry of clicks on the dashboard refresh button
spawns at most one tick (per second) rather than one per click.
