# Workflow Policy

Daedalus runs the `code-review` workflow for the repository configured above.

Shared rules:

- Keep scope narrow to the active issue and current lane state.
- Prefer small, reviewable diffs over speculative refactors.
- Run focused validation and report it honestly.
- Stop and surface blockers instead of guessing.
- Do not publish generated artifacts or unrelated files.

Role intent:

- `coder`: implement the next correct change and leave a clean handoff.
- `internal-reviewer`: review correctness, regressions, and test honesty before publish.
- `external-reviewer`: provide an optional second-pass review when enabled.
